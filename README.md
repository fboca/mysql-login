# Getting Started with MySQL-Login

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). \
DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION! THE CREDENTIALS ARE COMPLETELY TRANSPARENT IN `localStorage`. THIS SOFTWARE IS NOT OPTIMISED.

## 1. Connecting MySQL server with the Node.JS Backend

First we need to get the server connected to a MySQL instance and create the database. In the server directory, you can run:

### `vim index.js`

Now go to line 15 and please enter your MySQL server credentials.

## 2. Creating the database with the required columns
After the credentials are provided corectly to the server, please make sure you have created the MySQL table with the name `users` in a new database as following: 
    Columns: userId(INT, primarykey, notnull); username(VARCHAR, notnull); password(VARCHAR, notnull); profilePicture(VARCHAR); displayName(VARCHAR, notnull)

## 3. Running and testing
In the project directory, you can run:

`npm start` - this starts the react.js web server\
`cd server` - changes directory to the server parent\
`node index` - runs the server

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
